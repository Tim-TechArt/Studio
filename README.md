# Studio
My little VFX Studio
### Introduction
This project is set up from a blank template. I'm building everything from the ground up to understand every aspect of how a game works in Unreal Engine 5.<br> 
However, I'm not a 3D modeler nor an animator, so for these parts, I will use free assets.

## Currently working on:
* Animation montage so I can stitch together animations for an attack effect.
