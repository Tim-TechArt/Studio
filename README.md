# Studio
My little VFX Studio
## Introduction
This project is set up from a blank template. I'm building everything from the ground up to understand every aspect of how a game works in Unreal Engine 5.<br> 
However, I'm not a 3D modeler nor an animator, so for these parts, I will use free assets.<br> 
At some point, I'll also be shifting parts of the Blueprint logic into C++ to gain a deeper understanding of how this aspect operates. <br> 
I'm doing this project in my spare time so it will probably be a bit slow :) <br>
<br> 
This will end up with an attack effect that will be triggered in-game.

## Progress

### Currently working on:
* Animation montage so I can stitch together animations for an attack effect.
